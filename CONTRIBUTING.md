# Contributing to Kora AI

This document defines the development and collaboration conventions for the Kora AI project.

## 1. General Guidelines

* Technical names must be written in English.
* Keep code organized into small, cohesive modules with clearly defined responsibilities.
* Avoid unnecessary duplication and keep implementations as simple as possible.
* Changes should be related to the User Story being implemented.
* Do not introduce technologies, dependencies, or architectural changes without prior agreement from the team.

## 2. Naming Conventions

Technical names must use English and follow the conventions of the language or technology being used.

### Python

| Element     | Convention         | Example              |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Variables   | `snake_case`       | `user_context`       |
| Functions   | `snake_case`       | `get_user_context()` |
| Classes     | `PascalCase`       | `UserContext`        |
| Constants   | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRIES`        |
| Files       | `snake_case`       | `user_service.py`    |
| Directories | `snake_case`       | `agent_service/`     |

### General Technical Elements

* API endpoints should use clear, consistent, and resource-oriented names.
* Environment variables must use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
* Models, schemas, services, and other technical components must use descriptive names that clearly represent their responsibility.
* Avoid ambiguous abbreviations and names that do not communicate the purpose of the element.

Technology-specific conventions may be defined when the corresponding technology is introduced into the project.

## 3. Branches

Branches must follow the format:

```text
type/HU-XXX
```

The following branch types are defined:

| Type       | Purpose                                           | Example           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `feature`  | New functionality or User Story implementation    | `feature/HU-003`  |
| `fix`      | Bug correction                                    | `fix/HU-003`      |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                             | `docs/HU-001`     |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without changing functionality | `refactor/HU-003` |
| `test`     | Adding or modifying tests                         | `test/HU-003`     |

For the implementation of a User Story, `feature/HU-XXX` should be the standard branch type.

The other branch types should be used only when the corresponding change requires an independent branch.

Examples:

```text
feature/HU-003
fix/HU-003
docs/HU-001
refactor/HU-003
test/HU-003
```

The `main` branch must contain integrated and reviewed changes only.

## 4. Commits

Commits must reference the User Story they belong to.

Format:

```text
type(HU-XXX): description
```

Allowed commit types:

* `feat` — New functionality
* `fix` — Bug correction
* `docs` — Documentation changes
* `test` — Tests
* `refactor` — Code restructuring without changing functionality

Examples:

```text
feat(HU-003): add food catalog endpoint
fix(HU-003): handle invalid request
test(HU-003): add food endpoint tests
docs(HU-003): update API documentation
```

Commits should be clear and describe the change they introduce.

A User Story may contain multiple commits while it is being developed.

## 5. Pull Requests

When a User Story is ready for integration, the developer must create a Pull Request from the corresponding feature branch into `main`.

Pull Requests must:

* Clearly indicate the User Story being implemented.
* Describe the changes made.
* Include relevant tests or validation performed.
* Meet the acceptance criteria of the User Story.
* Be reviewed by at least one other team member.

The author of a Pull Request cannot approve or merge their own Pull Request.

## 6. Code Review

Reviewers should verify:

* The implementation follows the project's conventions.
* The changes correspond to the User Story.
* The code is understandable and appropriately modular.
* No unnecessary changes or dependencies were introduced.
* Tests and acceptance criteria are adequately covered.

Any relevant issue should be addressed before the Pull Request is merged.

## 7. Integration Process

The standard development workflow is:

```text
User Story
    ↓
Create feature/HU-XXX
    ↓
Develop and commit changes
    ↓
Run tests and validations
    ↓
Create Pull Request
    ↓
Code Review
    ↓
Approval
    ↓
Merge into main
```

After merging, the feature branch may be deleted if it is no longer needed.

## 8. Documentation

Documentation should be updated when a change affects:

* Project setup
* Development workflow
* Architecture
* APIs
* Configuration
* Development conventions

Documentation must use English for technical content and follow the structure established by the project.
